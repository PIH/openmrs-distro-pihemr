# Deploying the PIHEMR Distribution using Docker Compose

This project contains the relevant files to run the PIHEMR distribution using Docker.  
It utilizes docker-compose, which enables connecting several independent
dockerized services together (in this case MySQL and Tomcat), and maintaining configuration 
for these within a docker-compose.yml file.

If you haven't already done do, you will need to [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) 
and [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

### Step 1:  Download the necessary deployment artifacts

This Docker container mounts in several host files/directories to provide the webapps, modules, 
and initial database script.

### Step 2:  Adjust the included configuration files as needed

There is a default ".env" file included with the default values.  Overriding this for a "ces" 
environment, might look like this:

```
COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=ces
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root
MYSQL_PASSWORD=openmrs
MYSQL_PORT=3308
OPENMRS_SERVER_PORT=8080
MYSQL_INITIAL_DB_PATH=~/environments/ces/initial-db.sql
OPENMRS_WEBAPPS_PATH=~/environments/ces/webapps
OPENMRS_MODULES_PATH=~/environments/ces/modules
MIREBALAIS_PUPPET_PATH=~/code/mirebalais-puppet
PIH_CONFIG=mexico,mexico-demo
```

These parameters should be modified to meet your environment.

You may also override the following defaults that are included:

```
OPENMRS_MEMORY_OPTS="-Xmx2048m -Xms1024m -XX:PermSize=256m -XX:MaxPermSize=512m -XX:NewSize=128m"
OPENMRS_OTHER_OPTS="-server -Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom -Djava.awt.headless=true -Djava.awt.headlesslib=true"
```

### Step 3:  Build images and run the containers for the first time

From the base directory (the one that contains your docker-compose.yml file) run:

`docker-compose up --build`

This should successfully start and run MySQL and Tomcat, running the OpenMRS web application

### Step 4:  Start/Stop this

To stop, Ctrl-C out of it.  You could also bring down by typing:

`docker-compose down`

You can start it back up again with:

`docker-compose up`

To start it in the background and regain the terminal:

`docker-compose up -d`


### Working with the running containers

Some useful commands that are helpful to work with these containers while they are running:

**Open up a bash shell for working within a container**: 

`docker exec -it <container-name> /bin/bash`

For example, let's say you want to use the mysql client within the mysql container to look around the database a bit:

1. `docker ps` - will show you the names of which containers are running.
2. `docker exec -it container_name /bin/bash` - this will put you into a bash shell __inside__ the container.  It will look something like `root@d7e7bd809849:/#`
3. `mysql -u openmrs -p openmrs` - Now that you are inside the container, you can run the normal slew of mysql commands as if it is local

**Tail the log file of a particular container**

`docker logs -f <container-name>` (see https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/logs/)

For example, let's say you want to tail the Tomcat logs":

1. `docker ps` - will show you the names of which containers are running.
2. `docker logs -f container_name` - will tail the log file.  Hit Ctrl-C to exit.
