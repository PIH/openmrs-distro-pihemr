# Overview of the PIH-EMR

The *PIH-EMR* is a *distribution* of *OpenMRS*, an open-source medical record systems

A few links from the OpenMRS wiki that are worth reading:

* High-level overview of OpenMRS: https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/Introduction+to+OpenMRS

* Overview of the OpenMRS data model: https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/Data+Model

* Definition of an "OpenMRS distribution" (of which the PIH-EMR is one): https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/OpenMRS+Distributions


Therep are 40+ OpenMRS modules that make up the PIH EMR, of which most are OpenMRS community modules, but we also have
several PIH-specific modules as well.  Of those there are four top-level modules that provide most of the PIH-specific configuration:

* mirebalais: https://github.com/PIH/openmrs-module-mirebalais

* mirebalaismetadata: https://github.com/PIH/openmrs-module-mirebalaismetadata

* mirebalaisreports: https://github.com/PIH/openmrs-module-mirebalaisreports

* pihcore: https://github.com/PIH/openmrs-module-pihcore


These modules do several things, but their main tasks are:

* Providing and setting up PIH-specific metadata (like the forms and concepts we use)

* Configuring exactly what modules are included in the PIH distribution
(see https://github.com/PIH/openmrs-module-mirebalais/blob/master/pom.xml#L53)

* Allow use to turn and off different functionality based on country and location

* Setting up PIH-specific reports


(Due to the organic way the PIH EMR developed, it's there's not always clear guidelines as to the distribution of
functionality between the the four modules, but generally Mirebalais metadata provides concepts, Mirebalais reports
provides reports, and Mirebalais and PIH Core provide other metadata and configuration. The mirebalais module runs at
the top of stack. For reference, "Mirebalais" refers to Hopital Universitaire Mirebalais where the PIH EMR was first installed.)

For deploying the PIH-EMR to our various staging and production servers, we use Puppet (https://puppet.com/)

Our Puppet configuration scripts can be found here: https://github.com/PIH/mirebalais-puppet


# Communications and management

There are a few tools that we use extensively and that all PIH devs should have set up:

* Telegram for project-specific group chats (https://telegram.org/)

Please install Telegram on your development machine and then ask an existing developer to invite you to the appropriate groups.

* JIRA for managing project, bugs, sprints, etc: https://tickets.pih-emr.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa

Please request an account by asking another PIH developer or emailing medinfo@pih.org

# Setting up a Dev Environment

The preferred method to set up a development environment is using the OpenMRS SDK, with some custom configuration steps.

## Prerequisites


First, install git, mvn, and the OpenMRS SDK by following the "Installation" instructions here:

https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/OpenMRS+SDK#OpenMRSSDK-Installation

The OpenMRS SDK uses the H2 database by default, but H2 doesn't work with some of the
modules we use, so we must use MySQL, which needs to be configured separately. To do this, you can either
install MySQL directly on your machine, or install mysql within a docker container.

If installing directly, install MySQL Community Server 5.6 following the instructions for your platform. It must be
version 5.6, other versions will not work.

An easier approach is likely to install Docker (https://www.docker.com/) and use the OpenMRS SDK to set up an instance of MySQL within a docker container.


## Setup


### Step 1: Clone the "mirebalais-puppet" project
The various configuration files that determine what applications and options are turned on on different servers are
found here and later on in process you will need to tell OpenMRS where to find them.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/PIH/mirebalais-puppet.git
```

### Step 2: (If you are directly installing MySQL on your machine) Ensure that MySQL has a password set up for the root user.
- If you are able to run ```$ mysql -u root``` and access the MySQL Monitor without receiving an access denied error,
it means that there is no root password set and you have to set it following the instructions here: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/resetting-permissions.html
- Once the root password has been set, you should be able to access the MySQL Monitor by running:  
  ```$ mysql -u root -p``` followed by entering the password when prompted.  

### Step 3: Set up the environment
Set up the environment via the following command, chhosing the serverId and dbName you want to use. Specify
the DB password for your root user as set in Step 2.
*Note that the environment will be set up the directory ~/openmrs/[serverId]*
*The convention for dbNames are "openmrs_[some name]"*

```
$ mvn openmrs-sdk:setup -DserverId=[serverId] -Ddistro=org.openmrs.module:mirebalais:1.2-SNAPSHOT
```

* When prompted, select the port you'd like to run tomcat on

* When prompted, set the port to debug on (standard is 1044)

* Select which database you'd like to use

* If you are connecting to a MySQL 5.6 instance running on your local machine, specifc the URI, and a username and password to connect to the DB

* Select the JDK to use

### Step 4: Start up the server

```
$ mvn openmrs-sdk:run -DserverId=[serverId]
```

It should run for several minutes, setting up the database, (you may have to go to http://localhost:8080/openmrs to trigger this) BUT, in the end, it will fail.  You should cancel the current run (Ctrl-C in the terminal window).

After it fails, notice that a openmrs-runtime.properties file should have been created in the ~/openmrs/[serverId]

You will need to add two lines to these file, one specifying which of our configs to use for this server, and another
referencing the location of the config files (which you checked out as part of the mirebalais-puppet project above).
For instance, if you want to set up the Mirebalais CI environment, and you checked out the mirebalais puppet project
into your home directory, add the following into the runtime properties:

- pih.config=mirebalais,mirebalais-humci
- pih.config.dir=/[path to]/mirebalais-puppet/mirebalais-modules/openmrs/files/config

Then rerun:

```
$ mvn openmrs-sdk:run -DserverId=[serverId]
```

Startup should take several minutes as it loads in all required metadata, etc, for the first time.

### Step 5: Create a local identifier source
After startup, login
- Enter "http://localhost:8080/openmrs/login.htm" into the Chrome web browser
  - Log in with the following details:
    - Username: admin
    - Password: Admin123
  - (The password is the default password, it is referenced in the openmrs-server.properties file within the ~/openmrs/[serverId] folder)
- Enter the legacy admin page "http://localhost:8080/openmrs/admin"
- Go to "Manage Patient Identifier Sources" under the header "Patients"

Check if there is an existing local identifier source. If there isn't, you'll
need to create a local identifier source to generate "fake" ZL EMR IDs:
- Add a new "Local Identifier Generator" for the "ZL EMR ID" with the following settings:
  - Name: ZL Identifier Generator
  - Base Character Set: ACDEFGHJKLMNPRTUVWXY1234567890
  - First Identifier Base: 1000
  - Prefix: Y
  - Suffix: (Leave Blank)
  - Max Length: 6
  - Min Length: 6
- Link the local generator to the Local Pool of Zl Identifiers
  - Click the Configure Action next to the local pool
  - Set "Pool Identifier Source" to "ZL Identifier Generator"
  - Change "When to fill" to "When you request an identifier"

## Updating


Once you have installed the distribution, you should be able to update it with the following commands... 

If you are watching any modules, first execute "mvn openmrs-sdk:pull" to pull in any changes to these modules via git.

Then, from the base directory of the mirebalais project run the following two commands to update any changes to modules
you aren't watching:

```
$ git pull
$ mvn openmrs-sdk:deploy -Ddistro=api/src/main/resources/openmrs-distro.properties -U
```

(I have created a shell script shortcut to execute the two commands above, pihemrDeploy.sh)

To run the server: 
```
$ mvn openmrs-sdk:run
```

## Making Things Easy

### Aliases

(You might be able to set the "debug" flag at project creation time now. 
`pihemrDeploy.sh` is a utility script created by Mark Goodrich.)

```
$ alias omrs-pull='mvn openmrs-sdk:pull'
$ alias omrs-deploy='cd /home/mgoodrich/openmrs/modules/mirebalais && ./pihemrDeploy.sh'
$ alias omrs-run='mvn openmrs-sdk:run -Ddebug'
```

So to do a daily update of the system, run:

```
$ omrs-pull
$ omrs-deploy
$ omrs-run
```

### PyInvoke

There's an [Invoke](http://www.pyinvoke.org/) file for doing local development of the PIH EMR
[here](https://github.com/brandones/pih-emr-workspace/blob/master/tasks.py).
Feel free to make pull requests.


# Temporary steps to deploying custom build of OpenMRS-Core

We are temporarily running off an unreleased version of OpenMRS Core based off the master branch.
Once version 2.2.0 is released, we will switch to that branch, but in the meantime we will need
to check out and manually build the build of OpenMRS core we want to use:

1) If you haven't done so already, clone OpenMRS-Core:
https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-core.git

2) Make sure you are "watching" OpenMRS-Core; from the directory where you checked out core:
"mvn openmrs-sdk:watch"

3) Check out the following tag:
"git checkout tags/2.2.0-20181112.082045-243"

### Troubleshooting

If you see the following error when building core:

[ERROR] Failed to execute goal com.mycila:license-maven-plugin:3.0:check (default) on project openmrs-test: Execution default of goal com.mycila:license-maven-plugin:3.0:check failed: Cannot read header document license-header.txt. Cause: Resource license-header.txt not found in file system, classpath or URL: no protocol: license-header.txt -> [Help 1]

... then try commenting out the mycila plugin in the main pom of the project


# Source Code


All source code for OpenMRS is stored on Github, in either the OpenMRS organizaiton (for core and community modules) or 
the PIH organization (for PIH-specific modules).

https://github.com/openmrs
https://github.com/PIH

The naming convention for a module repo is "openmrs-module-[module_name]".

# Getting Set Up with IntelliJ


At least with `openmrs-module-pihcore`, IntelliJ may want to identify some 
directories as modules that are not modules,
and are in fact subdirectories of actual modules. The problem is that these phony modules don't inherit Maven
dependency information from the parent modules, so IntelliJ will fail to resolve references to those dependencies.
To fix this, go to Project Structure -> Modules and remove those directories.

Other than that, this project is more or less plug-and-play in IntelliJ.


# Troubleshooting Dependency Problems

## OpenMRS seems to be using different code than what I've got here in the module I'm working on!

You probably need to run mvn openmrs-sdk:install from your checked-out module's directory.

## OpenMRS displays errors like this after starting up, where `Foo` is the name of the module I'm working on:

## `Foo Module cannot be started because it requires the following module(s): Bar 1.2.3-SNAPSHOT`

`cd` out of your module's directory, then run

`mvn openmrs-sdk:deploy -DserverId=<serverId>`

When prompted, respond:

* 1 - module
* 2 - default (org.openmrs.module)
* 3 - Bar
* 4 - choose the latest snapshot version that you need
